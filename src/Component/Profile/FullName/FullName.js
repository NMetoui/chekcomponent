          I'm a web developer with training in web development at GOMYCODE. I am
          passionate about learning: I like to do research, explore new concepts
          and share my discoveries with others. I appreciate clarity and
          simplicity, and I integrate this approach into my development. Clean,
          sleek and intuitive code makes me smile and I aim to delight others
          with my programming.
